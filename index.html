I like to read mystery books. I read many books like Famous Five,Secret Seven,Nancy Drew and The Five Find-Outers and Dog. I also read Noddy,The Three Investigaters and many other books.

I read before I go to bed when my school work is all done. This is my last activity of the day. I am lucky that we have got a good library close by. I borrow about 5 books at a time and I can keep them for 15 days.The library has a very good selection of mystery books. I started reading hardcover fairy tale books like Bambi and Dumbo. Now, I am on Enid Blyton and Nancy Drew books. I hope to progress to reading more serious books as I grow older. This library has books for teenagers and young adults too.

    I like to draw a lot. I especially like to design birthday cards for my friends. I also make other cards for my friends like New Year cards,Christmas cards and Diwali cards. I sometimes draw pictures and hang them on the wall, but my mother does not allow me to put up all my drawings. She says it will spoil the walls. I would like to join a professional drawing course, but unfortunately I have to wait for the Covid restrictions to be relaxed.
